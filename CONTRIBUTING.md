# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

Refer to the [Developer Setup](./SETUP.md) document to learn how to prepare your
environment.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your
contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your
contributions as part of the project. Head over to
<https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or
to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Community Guidelines

This project follows
[Google's Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).

### Community Etiquette

The project maintainers team actively try to make the project successful, but
unfortunately have a limited set of time to address issues. 

To help make the project easier to manage, contributors can help:
- Create issues for proposed changes focused around addressing classes
of problems/enhancements instead of specific instances of them. 
- Do not create many different minor PRs for movement of files, this makes
figuring out the pedigree of the code more difficult (e.g. using git blome).
- Be understanding that maintainers may have a different point of view and
that they are the ones maintaining the code, and that maintainers may consider
your viewpoint but may not always agree. 
- Be understanding that there may be some lead time in getting responses to
certain issues, especially if they are not blocking or in the critical path
of project milestones.

## Getting Started

The project is managed via Github. For contributors that would like to find a
good place to start, take a look at the "good first issues" and "help wanted"
labels
[(filter link here)](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

We also have a [slack channel](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C03U677QD46)
that you can reach us at and ask questions!
